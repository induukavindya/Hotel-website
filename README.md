## Hotel Website

this is my first HTML + CSS + JavaScript project; a homepage of a simple hotel website. It is not fully responsive yet. I'm still working on making it a fully responsive website.
there is a header with a logo and some tabs, with a beautiful mouse-over underline effect. 
then there's a background image slider with a message on top of it. made the image slideshow using JS.
there's a button which also has a mouse-over effect. 
next there is a small description about the hotel. 
after that there's a form which can be used to book hotel rooms. you can select the dates, number of adults and kids and number of rooms. this part of the webpage is fully responsive. 
next there are information about booking rooms, booking the hotel for weddings and meals.
finally there's a footer with social media, contact adresses and hyperlinks for the top of the site.
